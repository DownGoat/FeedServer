/feeds details
==============
* Sending a POST request should create a new feed, the request should be
JSON in the expected format.

* Sending a GET request should return a list of all the feeds,
maybe there should be a limit and offset for this?

* PUT request should do a bulk update of feeds, and the request
should include a list of feeds to update.

* DELETE request should delete all the feeds for that user.
